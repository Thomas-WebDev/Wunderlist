https://abovegoal.com/guestprep/

You will generally place an order for two shows at a time and will escrow $3.75 per each two shows. (They are paid $1.875 per piece of artwork) 

You have seen the artwork on LinkedIn for the past few weeks that they have done. 

In January we are going to start a Wednesday edition of the show with interviews, they will need to refashion the poster to include the photo of the person that we are interviewing. When we start the interview series for ABGP they will start getting paid $7.5 per order of artwork for two weeks.

They have a habit of uploading the completed product in Upwork messages but its important that they upload the completed work via this link as well:

Post Format A
How does your organization intend to change the world? On today's monologue, I talk about the importance of having a 'Blank Check Plan'.

In the second segment, I spotlight the Tucson Botanical Gardens.

Clients and prospects can stick around for the later segments to hear my quarterly letter to clients and Above Goal's value proposition for fundraising firms.

Rachel Nicole Sage Battle I am speaking up one because he is a good friend of mine and 2 because sis I've been in this group for a few now and I've watched you damn near attack every person that post to this group. Notice I said damn near. You disagree with about 80 no 92.4 percent of the content from which come from a man or just don't fit your ideology of how you live your truth. Sis this isn't for everyone to like and agree with but not everything needs an opinion. How is he 'flexing' because he's asking where are the beautiful women that find themselves sexy in whatever form they feel…I guess it's seriously true about blacks in this town really can't support or acknowledge another one of us without some form of hate. Love US first. and please don't take what I'm saying to you in some form of disrespectful attack on you I'm just calling a spade a spade. Peace be unto you sis

It doesn't jive with White expectation. Its baffling, its intimidating, is mesmerizing, but not what you as a White person will allow 

A difficult Negro. Whiteness as a collective is like an electric fence around Black liberation. Whenever we move to far out to pasture we are shot down with nary an explanation. 

You turned us on each other to maintain your economic system and to build your country and you want to talk about 80% Black crime is our fault. Whiteness is built ontop of our disharmony, you literally profit every moment from it. Yet its still our fault. I just don't understand. 

Well Ken its your victim mentality. Oh so you think we equal? We're equal in America but we are not EQUAL in America. The smart mentality is to recognize that…..so you don't get you ass killed in America.

For some that recognition kills dream of America for them. But thats why I love Martin Luther King because he dared to dream in America. 

Dreaming in America take a lot of courage, because America has a habit of killing Black dreams and ambitions and the bodies that hold them.

But you can't kill our spirit.

I didn't have to be the boss or the advisor I just got to be an employee. I served Aon's clients as I always have with vigor, straightforwardness, and honesty. 

When I was 21 I  began my career as a Team Room Strategy Consultant at Aon. I participated in Aon's second Early Career Development Program class in 2006 and rotated through the Corporate Strategy team - xx, and completed the program with the Enterprise Risk Management practice serving clients in these industries.

I've contributed to programs and curriculum for two fellowship programs. Education Pioneers and campusCATALYST. Continuing my interest in fellowships, I worked with

I love to joke around and I appreciated working here because I got to be a cog in a wheel of a system I could not control. I didn't have to lead. I didn't have to manage. Working at Everise has helped me find my good enough. I say this to say, I got to be myself here, my good and bad self. I never get to be bad.
